# useful-toolsets Â· a Node.JS application to help

My personal collection of tools that I have made, for myself, to supercharge my laziness with 320 Watts fast charging.
This is a Node.JS project, because my mind already went to power saving mode whilst picking a Language.

Some of the tools may open up a GUI window as well, to escape from the Terminal interface's limitations.

## Executing this toolset, and the How-to's

Using this toolbox is pretty easy if you have ever navigated via a Terminal interface.

**Left**, and **Right**, **Up**, and **Down**, that's how you move. \
**Enter** to accept, **Backspace** to cancel. \
**Escape** to finalise, and **Tab** to select.

### Preparations, and what you will need

- Node.JS installed to your Machine. Preferably the latest LTS version.
- a Graphical environment, for when using some *tools* that require opening a GUI interface.
